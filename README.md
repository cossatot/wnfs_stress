#WNFS Stress

## Topographic and tectonic stress in (and around) the Western Nepal Fault System


This is the code, data, and manuscript components for a paper using
topographic stresses and fault slip data (including the 2015 Gorkha earthquake)
to invert for the tectonic stress in the Nepal Himalaya, and to explain the
style and distribution of faulting in the south-central Indo-Asian orogen.
