Abstract 250 words

Maybe 3500 words w/ 4 figs (2 big, 2 small)


# Intro
- Himalaya/Tibet long known for topo/fault kinematics relationship
- somewhat explained with Molnar topo, orogen collapse, etc.
- scale of fault kinematic transitions not known, but are common on ~10km scales
- New observations of WNFS show transitions well

# Fault type transitions on the Karakoram-Western Nepal Fault system

- KF-WNFS description
- observations of some sort

# Stress Modeling
- brief methods
- results

# Discussion




Figure List:
1: Tibet overview, w/ several insets
2: KF-WNFS map
3: 


# other notes

%This mechanical explanation of instantaneous deformation is embedded in
%while Dewey had a dynamic explanation involving orogenic growth and collapse.


%% any stuff about this being applied elsewhere?  Luttrell?  Copley?

- maybe state in the intro that the big problem is that orogen-scale mechanics are different; no isostatic support, shear stresses from topographic slopes still stong


# todo:

- add points to fig 1a where Fig Sx sites are

- look up MHT stress accumulation rate (maybe for kix)
- need to pick apart molnar + lyon-caen to find more assumptions that are invalid at smaller scale.

# extra discussion



(this study documents faults which change their kinematics from strike-slip to
normal when cutting pre-existing topographic highs. this demonstrates that the
stresses caused by topography can perturb the local stress field sufficiently
to change kinematics, which then places bounds on the stress fields at the time
the fault formed. it may indicate, therefore, that Tibet had already reached
a sufficient elevation when these faults initiated (mid-Miocene?) that the
$S_{H\min}$ and $\sigma_v$ were near equal at that time, and that the plateau
was close to its modern elevation.

Though almost all active mountain ranges show a similar pattern of thrusting
at the low elevations, and strike-slip or normal faults at higher elevations,
topographic modulation of fault kinematics has not been demonstrated. This may
indicate that active faults in these regions predate the modern stress regime,
or simply that the principal stresses are far enough from equality that
topographic stress perturbations do not cause a switch in the relative strengths
of the stresses.)



(almost all active mountain belts show this pattern: Alps, Andes, Cascades,
...).

(Analogous fault kinematic modulation between strike-slip and reverse faulting
due to pre-existing topographic highs or lows is not clearly documented in the
Himalaya or Tibet at the 1-10 km scale. However, Cowgill et al. (*2004*) show
that the Akato Tagh restraining bend of the Altyn Tagh fault system is
dominated by strike-slip faulting where fault-generated topography is higher,
but at lower elevations <15 km away, reverse-oblique slip is present, raising
the possibility that slip kinematics can evolve with changes in local
topography, i.e. a thrust-dominated or mixed thrust and strike-slip restraining
bend can evolve into a strike-slip dominated system with topographic growth.
Furthermore, they suggest that the general tendency of the Altyn Tagh system to
be slightly transtensile in the southeast where it daylights on top of the
northern Tibetan plateau margin, and slightly transpressive in the northeast
where it is north of the plateau, is due to variations in topographic stress.)
